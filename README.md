# Converting Traionis to Astro

This project was discarded and is only kept as an archive.

Encountered problems:
* Need to define types for each field for the Content API
* Content API getters aren't perfect
* Cannot dynamically import svg as components (or as plain html) easily, was able to do it only for the dev server and not able to build for production
* console logs don't really work for astro functions, need to use their debug component instead.
* Not really a great experience but it's not bad either
* Vite is still a problem in this setup
